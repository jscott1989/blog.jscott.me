      <description>I picked this book up on a whim because it was cheap and had been on my &amp;ldquo;to read&amp;rdquo; list for a while.
It covers a number of Computer Science algorithms by relating them to real life examples where they are useful. For example the book relates the optimal stopping problem to renting a house, sorting algorithms to organising book shelves, etc.
I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of value in taking the book&amp;rsquo;s recommendations as practical advice, but this is the first book I&amp;rsquo;ve read that seems like it could explain some interesting algorithms to people not previously interested.</description>

      <title>Soft Skills: The software developer&#39;s life manual</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been reading Soft Skills: The software developer&amp;rsquo;s life manual, by John Sonmez.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t previously encountered John&amp;rsquo;s work, but was recommended this book a few times as &amp;ldquo;an essential guide to a fulfilling software development career&amp;rdquo;.
The book is different from most books aimed at developers in that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover a new language or technology, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t talk about managing people or building a good development culture. Instead it tries to provide overall life and career guidance.</description>
