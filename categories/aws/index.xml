      <description>If you have a large number of EC2 instances running in an AWS environment, it can be difficult to really understand what is happening in production.
In particular, when you use autoscaling groups, it can be difficult to notice when and why your instances are dying and requiring a restart. For the most part this isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem, but in rare cases it&amp;rsquo;s possible to run up large bills by restarting instances too frequently (for example if a system fails to start and so is constantly rebooted), and though usually you&amp;rsquo;re perfectly happy for your machines to die and be automatically replaced, sometimes it can be useful to jump on to a dead machine to figure out what went wrong.</description>
