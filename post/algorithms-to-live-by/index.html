			<p>I picked this book up on a whim because it was cheap and had been on my &ldquo;to read&rdquo; list for a while.</p>

<p>It covers a number of Computer Science algorithms by relating them to real life examples where they are useful. For example the book relates the optimal stopping problem to renting a house, sorting algorithms to organising book shelves, etc.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not so sure there&rsquo;s a lot of value in taking the book&rsquo;s recommendations as practical advice, but this is the first book I&rsquo;ve read that seems like it could explain some interesting algorithms to people not previously interested.</p>

<p>For example, the book discusses the optimal stopping problem in terms of dating, suggesting that the mathematically optimal way to pick the best partner is to just look for ~37% of the time, and then settle with the next option which is better than those that came before.</p>

<p>The book explains some of the maths behind this and gives other interesting examples of where it could be relevant, but I don&rsquo;t see many people turning to it as an actual solution to finding a partner.</p>

<p>I felt that the book lost its way a little in the later chapters. While it was still interesting I think by the point of talking about overfitting models and relaxing requirements the analogies to real life were starting to get a little weak.</p>

<p>Either way, the book is cheap and it&rsquo;s a nice little read particularly for non-technical people to understand a little about how Computer Science works.</p>
