			<p>My wife&rsquo;s phone was stolen last week. Though her data is password (/fingerprint) protected, and all of her passwords are stored in <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> behind a <a href="https://blog.agilebits.com/2011/06/21/toward-better-master-passwords/">strong master password</a>, she still felt more comfortable after changing the passwords for things accessible from her phone.</p>

<p>Since she was doing it, I decided to go through and change some of the passwords I haven&rsquo;t changed in some time. While doing that I found three common ways that websites would inconvenience me.</p>

<p><strong>Just let me delete my account</strong></p>

<p>For a lot of the accounts, the reason the password hasn&rsquo;t been changed sooner is because those accounts just haven&rsquo;t been used in a very long time. For some of them I wasn&rsquo;t even sure what the website was and when I signed up.</p>

<p>For these websites, my preference is to just delete the account, but when looking I found that surprisingly few sites actually let you do that. For these, I removed anything on the profile that relates to me, changed the password to something random, and abandoned the account. There&rsquo;s really no reason to not allow people to delete their account.</p>

<p><strong>I haven&rsquo;t forgotten my password</strong></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-25-at-12.48.36.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2018-03-25-at-12.48.36" /></p>

<p>So many websites just don&rsquo;t let you change your password. Or at least, they don&rsquo;t make it easy. For several websites the only way I could find to change my password was to go to &ldquo;Forgot my password&rdquo; and wait for a reset email. Changing your password is such basic functionality for any website with accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Frustrating password policies</strong></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-25-at-12.46.06.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2018-03-25-at-12.46.06" /></p>

<p>The worst is when services put arbitrary restrictions on your password. This screenshot is from Virgin Media. Why in the world would they have a maximum length? and restricting special characters? and the first character has to be a letter?</p>

<p>It suggests that they are probably storing the password directly, rather than hashing them, which is very worrying if that data is ever compromised. A quick search of Twitter shows that Virgin Media are not the only ones with strange password policies.</p>
