			<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been reading <a nofollow target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1617292397/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1617292397&linkCode=as2&tag=jonnlearchin-21&linkId=357ef9cc213049c3374c531cf41ebc0a">Soft Skills: The software developer&rsquo;s life manual</a>, by <a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com">John Sonmez</a>.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t previously encountered John&rsquo;s work, but was recommended this book a few times as &ldquo;an essential guide to a fulfilling software development career&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The book is different from most books aimed at developers in that it doesn&rsquo;t cover a new language or technology, and doesn&rsquo;t talk about managing people or building a good development culture. Instead it tries to provide overall life and career guidance. I some parts I think it succeeds, and in others it doesn&rsquo;t do so well.</p>

<p>Big take-aways from the book are that you should treat your career like a business, even if you only ever have one customer at a time. This means effectively marketing yourself, targeting your skills at a valuable niche, and actively tracking and managing your career towards specific goals. The book includes a lot of guidance on deciding your career goals, establishing a profile and marketing yourself, how to keep abreast of new technologies and learn new skills, and how to increase productivity (for example by using the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730">Pomodoro technique</a>).</p>

<p>The first half of the book covers all this and more, and though I did feel I knew a lot of this stuff going in, I think it&rsquo;s covered well and there are definitely things I&rsquo;ll take from the book.</p>

<p>The second part of the book is a lot more suspect. It has advice on becoming a landlord (as if the world needs more landlords), moves into fitness (where the author&rsquo;s advice is fine but not what I was looking for in the book), and ends with a chapter titled &ldquo;Sprit&rdquo; focusing on mindfulness.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty confident there&rsquo;s something in (the first half of) this book that will be new for almost every software developer working today. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1617292397/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1617292397&linkCode=as2&tag=jonnlearchin-21&linkId=357ef9cc213049c3374c531cf41ebc0a">It&rsquo;s worth taking a look</a>, but I&rsquo;d probably put it down before it starts talking about the power of positive thinking.</p>
